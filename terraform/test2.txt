When lambda function is executed it will invoke a glue job with s3 path 
Glue job will read data from the s3 and write the data into another bucket
During this process cloudwatch logs should be generated and when it is successfull it should invoke another lambda


Resources:
s3
lambda-2
glue
cloudwatch

Resource communication:
lambda is communicated with glue 
lambda is communicated with s3
glue is communicating with s3
glue is communicated with s3

iam roles:
role 1 lambda
role 2 for glue

iam policies:

cloudwatch policy

iam policies and its roles:
role is attached to s3 policy
role is attached to glue
role is attached to  CloudWatch

resource with roles:
